Story: You're quest is to return am amulet to your grandfather.

Gameplay Loop: You can choose what you want to do on your quest. You can:
  Venture forward: Does a random combat event where you fight an enemy and are rewarded
  Go to the town: You can visit the town to upgrade all your gear, spells, purchase arrows, and sleep
  Check your inventory: Shows all your gear's stats and your player stats
  Abandon your quest: This is how to save and quit the game.

Combat: You fight a random enemy with random health and random attacks all dependent on its type
  Goblins: Regular enemy, nothing special
  Skeletons: Use a bow so their damage is consistent during combat but they can miss
  Orcs: Stronger version of goblins

Options on your turn: The enemies next attack is always revealed and you attack first.
  Sword: 1 to 10 damage (1d10) plus your sword level
  Bow: consistant damge every turn, no randomization but it uses arrows
  Healing Spell: Recovers health equal to its current level, consumes Mana which is replenished 
   at the end of each combat. You can also upgrade your max Mana.
  Run away: You run away but can't replenish your mana back so your next fight will be much harder
